## Introduction

Euler's Formula, a fundamental gem in mathematics, uncovers a deep connection between the vertices, edges, and faces of 3D shapes. It states that for any polyhedron, the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces always equals 2. This seemingly simple equation is used to explore and understand complex shapes with precision and insight.
